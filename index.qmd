#### Welcome to the Biodiversity Genomics Europe + SciLifeLab Digital Hi-C Course!

With the collaboration of five research institutes, two industry partners, and several Universities, three streams of the HiC technique were filmed in 2024 onsite at BMC Uppsala. These have been digitized as an online course, openly available to all.
