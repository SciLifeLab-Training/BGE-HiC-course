In this course stream, expert users Giada Ferrari (University of Oslo, NO), Pamela Veneziano Broccia (CNAG, ES), and Tuuli Lundbäck-Larva (SciLifeLab, SE) worked together with expert instructor Brian Kilburn (Arima, US) to perform the Arima HiC protocol on challenging samples. As all group participants are experts in HiC, this group all contributed specialized knowledge of challenging sample preparation.

Filming was performed by Kristen Schroeder (SciLifeLab Training Hub).

## Challenging Samples Material
### Sample preparation

Eight challenging sample types were processed for Hi-C using the [Arima High Coverage HiC protocol](https://arimagenomics.com/wp-content/files/User-Guide-Arima-High-Coverage-for-Animal-Tissue.pdf). Watch the following videos for a walkthrough of each sample up to the crosslinking step.

| Preparation | Info | Runtime |
|------|------| ------|
| [Lichen](https://youtu.be/lBVAmwqkWtM) | Two lichen samples were processed by grinding in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle. | 30min |
| [Flustra](https://youtu.be/w8krCpK1JnQ) | The Flustra sample was ground using liquid nitrogen as for the Lichen samples | 3min |
| [Sponge](https://youtu.be/X5mpoOm4XaE) | A sponge was processed using the "squeeze method"; a gentle extraction of nuclei from the sponge skeleton | 25min |
| [Algae (slime)](https://youtu.be/tJ4bPKQfz5o) | Processing of an algae that produces an extracellular matrix. | 5min |
| [Mosquito](https://youtu.be/4ijoSwjzBuo) | Sample processing of mosquitos. Two different sample preparations were performed. | 12min |
| [Worm](https://youtu.be/7i-ZSZzC9_g) | Discussion of sample processing - one individual crosslinked in its entirety and dissolved easily without further disruption. | 3min |

[Sample crosslinking](https://youtu.be/ItkQ84fRKCA) - The eight sample types were batch processed from the crosslinking stage onwards. Includes discussion on handling insects, low input samples, recommended equipment, and sticky pellets. Runtime: 25 minutes.

### Estimating Input
[Estimating input](https://youtu.be/l8cSQLg7qss) - The estimating input protocol was performed on the two lichen samples. Runtime: 20 minutes.

### HiC Reactions
[HiC reactions](https://youtu.be/hS509Yb5l4g) - Follow the challenging samples group as they perform the enzymatic reactions on the challenging samples. Kai from Arima joins for day 3 of the protocol! Runtime: 50 minutes.

### QC1
[QC1 protocol and discussion for challenging samples](https://youtu.be/45N-Zs4lqwE) - The last step for the challenging reactions is to follow the QC1 protocol. Runtime: 13 minutes.

[Giada Ferrari, presenting the Challenging Samples lab results](https://youtu.be/dy4vxIIZKSM) - Presentation of the Challenging Samples results to all course participants, including discussion. Runtime: 17 minutes.

## Challenging Samples Discussion
Prior to the course, the challenging samples were sent to the participating institutions for processing. Each institution presented their own handling of samples, including nuclei isolation, kits, what organisms they had success with, as well as sample outcomes.
