### Sample preparation

Eight challenging sample types were processed for Hi-C. Watch the following videos for a walkthrough of each sample up to the crosslinking step.

#### Lichens
Two lichen samples were processed by grinding in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle. Runtime: 30 minutes.

#### Flustra 
The Flustra sample was ground using liquid nitrogen as for the Lichen samples. Runtime: 2.5 minutes.

#### Sponge
A sponge was processed using the "squeeze method"; a gentle extraction of nuclei from the sponge skeleton. Runtime: 30 minutes.

### Crosslinking
The eight sample types were batch processed from the crosslinking stage onwards. Includes discussion on handling insects, low input samples, recommended equipment, and sticky pellets. Runtime: 26 minutes.

### Estimating Input
The estimating input protocol was performed on the two lichen samples. Runtime: 22 minutes.
