The group who worked with the challenging samples consisted of Giada Ferrari (University of Oslo), Pamela Veneziano Broccia (CNAG), Tuuli Lundb√§ck-Larva (SciLifeLab Uppsala), and Brian Kilburn (Arima).


### Sample preparation

Eight challenging sample types were processed for Hi-C. Watch the following videos for a walkthrough of each sample up to the crosslinking step.

#### Lichens
Two lichen samples were processed by grinding in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle. Runtime: 30 minutes.

#### Flustra 
The Flustra sample was ground using liquid nitrogen as for the Lichen samples. Runtime: 2.5 minutes.
