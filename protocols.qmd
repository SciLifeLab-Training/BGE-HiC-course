## Protocol adaptations and tips
A representative from each institution presented specific adaptations and information on best practices for their sample processing, including a bioinformaticians view of HiC from Fernando Cruz Rodriguez.

## Challenging Samples Discussion
Prior to the course, the challenging samples were sent to the participating institutions for processing. Each institution presented their own handling of samples, including nuclei isolation, kits, what organisms they had success with, as well as sample outcomes--including with the AssemblyLink kit.

|[Plants and Algae](https://youtu.be/1n8cDAUcR1g)|Karine Labadie, Genoscope| 16min |
|[Plants and Lichens](https://youtu.be/-84jnDBsDOM)|Irene Fabiola Roman Maldonado, The Sanger Institute| 16min |
|[Coral and Sponge](https://youtu.be/r_4JdeZef4c)|Brian Kilburn, Arima| 8.5min |
|[Jellyfish and Coral](https://youtu.be/kVIRZuUVBvI)|Karine Labadie, Genoscope| 13min |
|[Monogyna spp.](https://youtu.be/--uDYopgWxI)|Morten Skage, University of Oslo| 5min |
|[Fish Blood - AssemblyLink](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vvJfDGH8jaVG7hZ7dKY29PLT1KdAbt7A/view?usp=share_link)|Morten Skage, University of Oslo|coming soon|
