    "text": "The group who worked with the challenging samples consisted of Giada Ferrari (University of Oslo), Pamela Veneziano Broccia (CNAG), Tuuli Lundbäck-Larva (SciLifeLab Uppsala), and Brian Kilburn (Arima).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe challenging samples content is currently in post-production and access is limited to participants\nIf you require access, please contact the course administrators\n\n\n\n\nSample preparation\nEight challenging sample types were processed for Hi-C. Watch the following videos for a walkthrough of each sample up to the crosslinking step.\n\nLichens\nTwo lichen samples were processed by grinding in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle. Runtime: 30 minutes.\nLichen sample preparation\n\n\nFlustra\nThe Flustra sample was ground using liquid nitrogen as for the Lichen samples. Runtime: 2.5 minutes.\nFlustra sample preparation\n\n\nSponge\nA sponge was processed using the “squeeze method”; a gentle extraction of nuclei from the sponge skeleton. Runtime: 30 minutes.\nSponge sample preparation\n\n\nAlgae (slime)\nProcessing of an algae that produces an extracellular matrix. Runtime: 5 minutes.\nAlgae (slime) sample preparation\n\n\nMosquitos\nSample processing of mosquitos. Two different sample preparations were performed. Runtime: 15 minutes.\nMosquito sample preparation\n\n\nWorm\nDiscussion of sample processing - one individual crosslinked in its entirety and dissolved easily without further disruption. Runtime: 2 minutes.\nWorm sample preparation\n\n\n\nCrosslinking\nThe eight sample types were batch processed from the crosslinking stage onwards. Includes discussion on handling insects, low input samples, recommended equipment, and sticky pellets. Runtime: 26 minutes.\nCrosslinking video\n\n\nEstimating Input\nThe estimating input protocol was performed on the two lichen samples. Runtime: 22 minutes.\nEstimating input video\n\n\nHiC Reactions\nFollow the challenging samples group as they perform the enzymatic reactions on the challenging samples. Kai from Arima joins for day 3 of the protocol! Runtime: 60 minutes.\nHiC Reactions video\n\n\nQC1\nThe last step for the challenging reactions is to follow the QC1 protocol. Runtime: 15 minutes.\nQC1 protocol and discussion for challenging samples",
