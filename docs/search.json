    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nThis course stream is currently in post-production and will be available August 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this course stream, Maria Gyftea (SciLifeLab, SE), Eunkyong Choi (SciLifeLab, SE), Laurie Bertrand (Genoscope, FR), Carmela Gissi (UniBari, IT), and Maria Laura Aguilera Gil (CNAG, ES) were led by expert instructor Lily Shiue from Dovetail (Cantata Bio) in the newly-released AssemblyLink protocol.\nFilming was performed by Maria Gyftea and Lily Shiue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe course material is organized from this group’s sample preparation to results discussion to demonstrate the protocol, with extra videos of troubleshooting.\nSkip to the full course playlist section to watch the full AssemblyLink course!\n\n\n\n\nTissue preparation\nSample preparation was performed by each participant according to how they usually disrupt tissues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation\nInfo\nRuntime\n\n\n\n\nHerring\nHerring tissue was disrupted in a mortar and pestle on wet ice with addition of liquid nitrogen.\n8.5min\n\n\nReindeer heart\nReindeer heart tissue was disrupted in a mortar and pestle laying in liquid nitrogen.\n10min\n\n\nReindeer Spleen\nReindeer spleen tissue was disrupted in a mortar and pestle laying in liquid nitrogen.\n7.5min\n\n\nKrill\nThe small krill sample was disrupted in a mortar and pestle laying in liquid nitrogen.\n7min\n\n\nMoose\nThe moose sample was preserved in ethanol. It was washed in PBS and disrupted in in a mortar and pestle laying in liquid nitrogen.\n7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSample preparation for lichens, worms, algae, sponges, and insects can be found in the Challenging Sample Preparation.\n\n\n\n\nLysate preparation\nThe AssemblyLink protocol was used when crosslinking and creating a lysate from the samples. Maria Gyftea demonstrates this protocol on the krill sample, including discussion with Lily. Runtime: 17 minutes.\nSample preparation\n\n\nLysate QC\nThe quality control protocol is performed on all samples in order to check if enough lysate has been created for the downstream procedures, and to determine its concentration and quality. The lysates are found to have very low yields. Runtime: 15.5 minutes.\nLysate QC 7\nThe lysates are run on the bioanalyzer to determine the quality of the lysate, and found to be underdigested. Runtime: 4 minutes.\nDiscussion of QC Results 8\n\n\nProximity Ligations\nWhile Lily repeats the AssemblyLink Sample preparation with higher input, the herring and reindeer spleen samples are chosen to proceed with the protocol. In the first step, chromatin capture is performed. Runtime: 4.5 minutes.\nChromatin Capture 9\nIn the next step, three ligation reactions and the crosslinking reversal reaction are performed. Runtime: 11 minutes.\nProximity Ligations 10\nFinally, the DNA is purified from the sample lysate. Runtime: 7 minutes.\nDNA Purification 11\n\n\nLibrary Preparation\nIn the final step of the protocol performed during the course, library preparation is performed on the herring and reindeer spleen samples from the first round. The protocol is performed up until the Index PCR stage, at which point the samples were stored for further analysis. Runtime: 8.5 minutes.\nLibrary Preparation 13\n\n\nTroubleshooting and additional attempts\nThe results of increasing input are not promising, as the samples are still underdigested. The AssemblyLink group discusses possible additions and controls. Runtime: 8 minutes.\nDiscussion of Results 2 12\nA third attempt is performed on the herring and reindeer spleen tissues with the inclusion of the cell isolation module. Additional controls and discussion is included, and we recommend watching the first sample preparation video first! Runtime: 24 minutes.\nSample Preparation 2 14\nLily Shiue, presenting the AssemblyLink HiC lab results\n\n\n\nCitation\nThe AssemblyLink protocol used in this course is © 2024, Cantata Bio, LLC.

Additionally, Irene demonstrated low input sample preparation for krill. The following videos demonstrate and discuss how to prepare samples for HiC.\nSample preparation instruction - Tissue weighing, handling tips and grinding with liquid nitrogen. Runtime: 22 minutes.\nSample crosslinking - Crosslinking the samples, and the importance of a homogenous solution. Runtime: 18 minutes.\nLow input sample preparation - The krill samples are crosslinked first, and then tissue grinding with a power masher. The differences between low and standard input protocols are discussed, and the samples chosen for the HiC reactions. Runtime: 13 minutes.\n\n\nEstimating Input\nEstimating input amount - Estimating input for krill and herring samples, and how low input and standard input approaches differ. Runtime: 9 minutes. ** Note: for a demonstration of steps 5-11 including Qubit quantification, see the Challenging Samples module!\nChoosing samples for HiC reactions - How to approach the decision on which input amounts to proceed with. Runtime: 6 minutes.\n\n\nHiC Reactions\nHiC Reactions - Follow along as the krill and herring are processed with the Arima HiC reactions. Runtime: 27 minutes.\n\n\nQC1\nQC1 - Considerations for when to proceed with QC1, and how the behaviour of the sample can indicate genomic differences. Runtime: 18 minutes.\nDiscussion of results & next steps - Interpretation of QC1 results and an overview of the next steps. Runtime: 6 minutes.\nIrene Fabiola Roman Maldonado, presenting the Introductory HiC lab results - The final group discussion of the results, led by Irene. Runtime: 15 minutes."
