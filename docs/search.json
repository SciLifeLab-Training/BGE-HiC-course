Additionally, Irene demonstrated low input sample preparation for krill. The following videos demonstrate and discuss how to prepare samples for HiC.\nSample preparation instruction - Tissue weighing, handling tips and grinding with liquid nitrogen. Runtime: 22 minutes.\nSample crosslinking - Crosslinking the samples, and the importance of a homogenous solution. Runtime: 18 minutes.\nLow input sample preparation - The krill samples are crosslinked first, and then tissue grinding with a power masher. The differences between low and standard input protocols are discussed, and the samples chosen for the HiC reactions. Runtime: 13 minutes.\n\n\nEstimating Input\nEstimating input amount - Estimating input for krill and herring samples, and how low input and standard input approaches differ. Runtime: 9 minutes. ** Note: for a demonstration of steps 5-11 including Qubit quantification, see the Challenging Samples module!\nChoosing samples for HiC reactions - How to approach the decision on which input amounts to proceed with. Runtime: 6 minutes.\n\n\nHiC Reactions\nHiC Reactions - Follow along as the krill and herring are processed with the Arima HiC reactions. Runtime: 27 minutes.\n\n\nQC1\nQC1 - Considerations for when to proceed with QC1, and how the behaviour of the sample can indicate genomic differences. Runtime: 18 minutes.\nDiscussion of results & next steps - Interpretation of QC1 results and an overview of the next steps. Runtime: 6 minutes.\nIrene Fabiola Roman Maldonado, presenting the Introductory HiC lab results - The final group discussion of the results, led by Irene. Runtime: 15 minutes."
