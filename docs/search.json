Runtime: 8.5 minutes.\nSample preparation: Herring\nReindeer heart tissue was disrupted in a mortar and pestle laying in liquid nitrogen. Runtime: 10 minutes.\nSample preparation: Reindeer heart\nReindeer spleen tissue was disrupted in a mortar and pestle laying in liquid nitrogen. Runtime: 7.5 minutes.\nSample preparation: Reindeer Spleen\nThe small krill sample was disrupted in a mortar and pestle laying in liquid nitrogen. Runtime: 7 minutes.\nSample preparation: Krill\nThe moose sample was preserved in ethanol. It was washed in PBS and disrupted in in a mortar and pestle laying in liquid nitrogen. Runtime: 7 minutes.\nSample preparation: Moose\n\n\nLysate preparation\nThe AssemblyLink protocol was used when crosslinking and creating a lysate from the samples. Maria Gyftea demonstrates this protocol on the krill sample, including discussion with Lily. Runtime: 17 minutes.\nSample preparation\n\n\nLysate QC\nThe quality control protocol is performed on all samples in order to check if enough lysate has been created for the downstream procedures, and to determine its concentration and quality. The lysates are found to have very low yields. Runtime: 15.5 minutes.\nLysate QC 7\nThe lysates are run on the bioanalyzer to determine the quality of the lysate, and found to be underdigested. Runtime: 4 minutes.\nDiscussion of QC Results 8\n\n\nProximity Ligations\nWhile Lily repeats the AssemblyLink Sample preparation with higher input, the herring and reindeer spleen samples are chosen to proceed with the protocol. In the first step, chromatin capture is performed. Runtime: 4.5 minutes.\nChromatin Capture 9\nIn the next step, three ligation reactions and the crosslinking reversal reaction are performed. Runtime: 11 minutes.\nProximity Ligations 10\nFinally, the DNA is purified from the sample lysate. Runtime: 7 minutes.\nDNA Purification 11\n\n\nLibrary Preparation\nIn the final step of the protocol performed during the course, library preparation is performed on the herring and reindeer spleen samples from the first round. The protocol is performed up until the Index PCR stage, at which point the samples were stored for further analysis. Runtime: 8.5 minutes.\nLibrary Preparation 13\n\n\nTroubleshooting and additional attempts\nThe results of increasing input are not promising, as the samples are still underdigested. The AssemblyLink group discusses possible additions and controls. Runtime: 8 minutes.\nDiscussion of Results 2 12\nA third attempt is performed on the herring and reindeer spleen tissues with the inclusion of the cell isolation module. Additional controls and discussion is included, and we recommend watching the first sample preparation video first! Runtime: 24 minutes.\nSample Preparation 2 14\nLily Shiue, presenting the AssemblyLink HiC lab results"
